The SQLite database is provided in Android to make saving data locally possible, but it involves quite a number of boilerplate code lines.So Room is a jetpack library, which was created as a wrapper around SQLite
It makes it easy to write complex SQL statements to query the data you need without having to go through every single column.

Components Of Room ->

# Entity ( analogous to object in programming )

# Dao(Data access object)
 - Data Access Objects are the main classes where you define your database interactions. They can include a variety of query         methods.
 - The class marked with @Dao should either be an interface or an abstract class. At compile time, Room will generate an             implementation of this class when it is referenced by a Database.

# Database
 - This class is annotated with @ database and extends the room database.
 - It contains the database setup with the entity and serves as the main access point to the database access point.




 TODO:
 1. Add the required dependencies and the "kapt" (kotlin annotation processing tool)
